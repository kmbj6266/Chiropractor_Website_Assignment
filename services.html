 	<div class="par1"><h3>Chiropractic Services</h3> Dr. Jennings has over 50 years of experience. He has a very gentle approach to chiropractic health. First a moist heat is applied to the areas of adjustment. This heat will allow the muscle to loosen up for adjustment. He uses the massage technique instead of the hard, invasive adjustments. He only uses his hands and no tools are used unlike other chiropractors. Tools are not natural and can cause more harm than good. He does require x-rays to evaluate your spine. Once he determines the plan for treatment, he will consult with you on the best plan to get you feeling better.

<div class="par1"><h3>Massage Services</h3>Our Massage Therapist, Meghan, has over 5 years of experience. She provides either a full body massage or a massage designated to certain areas of pain and stiffness. She also uses moist heat and if requested, uses hot stones. The stones are immersed in water and heated in an electric heater. The heat of the stones warm and relax the muscles, which allows her to apply deeper pressure, if desired. The warmth of the hot stones improves circulation and calms the nervous system. Some massage therapists place stones on points that are thought to be energy centers of the body to rebalance the body and mind.

<div class="par1"><h3>Nutritional Health Services</h3>
 Chronic inflammation contributes to many painful conditions, including osteoarthritis and back pain. Anti-inflammatory medicines such as aspirin, ibuprofen, and naproxen work well because they block the enzymes that trigger both swelling and pain. There are natural alternatives like turmeric, green tea, ginger, rosemary, cat's claw, devil's claw, and willow bark. Supplements such as Capsaicin, Glucosamine sulfate, SAMe, Magnesium and Acetyl-L-carnitine are helpful for all sorts of pain. These supplements can help relieve pain from rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, psoriasis, shingles, and diabetic neuropathy. They may also offer natural pain relief for back pain, fibromyalgia pain, and headaches. </div>
