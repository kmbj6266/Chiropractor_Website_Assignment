 	  <h3>Why Does Stress Make My Neck &amp; Back Hurt?</h3> 
 	The Sympathetic Nervous System releases chemicals that surge through your body causing blood to be directed straight to the muscles. This leads to suppression of the immune, digestive, and reproductive systems and increased muscle tone which you begin to perceive as &ldquo;tightness&rdquo;. Your heart rate and respiratory rate increases. This leads to increased blood pressure and overuse of accessory breathing muscles which connect the ribs, neck, head, jaw, back, and shoulder girdle. You feel the results of this in your tension headaches, jaw pain, neck and shoulder pain.

  <h3>Car Accidents & Spinal Injuries Aren't the Only Things To Cause Pain</h3>
 There can be many causes of back pain including accidents, strains, and injuries. But you may have been born with it.
 <ul>
   <li><strong>Spondylolisthesis:</strong> This is a slipping of vertebra that occurs at the base of the spine which is a birth defect or fracture of one or both wing-shaped parts of a vertebra.</li>
   <li><strong>Cervical Radiculopathy:</strong> Cervical radiculopathy is the damage or disturbance of nerve function that results if one of the nerve roots near the cervical vertebrae is compressed causing pain, weakness, and the loss of sensation in the neck, arms, or shoulders, depending on where the damaged roots are located.</li>
 </ul>

<br>
<div class="par1"><h3>Nutritional Health Services</h3>
  The bones, muscles and other structures in the spine need good nutrition and vitamins so that they are strong enough to support the body and to perform their other functions. Patients can integrate back-friendly vitamins and nutrients into their diets. Eating a balanced diet that includes the right amount and variety of vitamins and nutrients will reduce back problems by nourishing the bones, muscles, discs and other structures in the spine. Particular importance is given to calcium.</div>
